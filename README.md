Web Developer Bootcamp - beginner portfolio exercises 2024
A series of beginner exercise to learn html elements. 

Welcome to my html portfolio. Since I've just started to learn about HTML, I've decided to create a small pure HTML portfolio to showcase the skill I learned. 
Note: There's no CSS nor javascript involved in here. This is just a place for me to showcase some simple projects that I've created using pure HTML.
