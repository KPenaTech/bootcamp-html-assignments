<h1>The Best Movies According to Karen</h1>
<h2>My Top Movies of All-Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Liar Liar</h3>
<p>It's one of my favorite childhood movies and Jim Carrey is just a great actor.</p>

<h3>Avatar: The Way of Water</h3>
<p>I was obsessed with this movie when it came out. The harmony between colorful imagedry, the music, the characters is just magical. This movie captivates my soul and inspries me to rewatch 100 times. I also love the disney ride in Animal Kingdom. 10/10 Recommended.</p>

<h3>White Chicks</h3>
<p>Somehow it's a comfort movie I can rewatch for good laughter and have it playing in the background. Anyone else loves this movie?</p>
